## ðŸ§  Approach

1. Perform a **self-join** on the `employee` table:
   - Join `e1` (employees) with `e2` (managers) where `e1.manager_id = e2.id`.
2. Filter records where the **employee's salary is greater than the manager's salary**.
3. Select and return the employeeâ€™s `first_name` and `salary`.
